<h1>Elijah McGowen Resume</h1>

<h2>About Me/Volunteering</h2>
<p>I graduated from Manchester High School, and I’m currently furthering my education at Guilford College, where I’ve decided to study accounting. I plan to graduate with a bachelor’s in accounting and go on to get my masters too. During the Summer of 2024, I plan to get an internship to gain experience in my field of study. Frequently, I volunteer with <a href="MIM.html">Miracles in Motion</a>. Miracles in Motion is a non profit corporation that is designed to provide people with special needs with a full dance experience. In addition, I’ve also volunteered for Friends Group & Jewel Class through my church, The Chapel. Lastly, I volunteered for <a href="Richmond-Strikers.html">Richmond Strikers</a>. Richmond Strikers is a non profit organization that is committed to providing an effective, dynamic, and progressive athlete experience for their sport. During my service of volunteering I was a youth 12 coach for soccer.</p>
